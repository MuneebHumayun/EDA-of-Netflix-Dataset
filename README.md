My Work: I have done EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on this data set.


About Dataset:
The dataset I'm using for this project is publically availible on kaggle uploaded by VICTOR SOEIRO with name 'Netflix TV Shows and Movies' under license. The datset is about Movies and TV Shows listings on Netflix (May, 2022). The dataset isn't primary or secondry so it might contain many errors. This analysis would have been more interesting and helpful to Netfilx if there was another column which contained number of views of each movie/show. In my opionion this data is incomplete.
I want see which country release most of movies or which genres was listed on Netflix(may, 2022) the most. Which country prefer movies or shows. let's see which kind of tiltes movies have been used the most and what kind of stories were listed on netflix(may, 2022). I also wanted to see which kind of age certification is required to watch these movies, so that parents decides weather it's a good or bad idea to buy netflix account for their kids. I wanted to find interesting relationships between 'imdb_score', 'imdb_votes' with each other and with 'tmdb_score', 'tmdb_popularity' but unfortunately there are alot of missings values. so I removed 'imdb_score', 'imdb_votes' columns
